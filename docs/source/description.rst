Context
------------

Based on its generic behaviour, each **Macop** algorithm runs can be represented as an interactive loop where you can interact with and specify your needs at each step:

The package is strongly oriented on combinatorial optimisation (hence discrete optimisation) but it remains possible to extend for continuous optimisation.


Installation
------------

Just install package using `pip` Python package manager: 

.. code:: bash
   
   pip install macop
